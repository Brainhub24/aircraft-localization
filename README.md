# Ground Truth and Evaluation Code

The ground truth and the submissions of the winners have been made available. The evaluators used for round 1 and 2 are also published here.


# Code of the winners
The code of the winning teams is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license as required by the rules of the competitions: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/cyd-campus-aircraft-localization-competition/challenge_rules

Round 1:
The winning teams were all very close, using traditional multilateration techniques as their basis.

Place	Team              	RMSE [m]

1st		richardalligier   	25.02

2nd		ZAViators         	25.817 	

3rd		ck.ua             	26.214 

4th		sergei_markochev	33.544 

5th		dataWizard        	59.467 	


Round 2: 
In the second round, we used a hidden score for ranking. As the task was more complex, the results were slightly worse than round 1, however, the participants were still very close with a lot of outstanding performances.

Place   Team              	RMSE [m]

1st     sergei_markochev   	81.890

2nd 	ck.ua         		98.370	

3rd     nwpu.i4Sky          154.574

4th     ZAViators		 	171.663

5th	    dataWizard        	2392.535
